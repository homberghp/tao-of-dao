pedantic dao example

This repo contains a dao implementation using modern java techniques.

It is pedantic, because:

1. It does not need annotaions in its API, because we think reflection is overused.
2. When we use reflection, we do that at build time, not at compile time. That is: just once in the lifetime of the code.
3. We use naming conventions and are very strict at that. This avoids annotations.
